How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are many ways to ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, and simple to implement. In terms of simple ways to go about insuring this security, it is valuable to make sure that the program is no more complicated than it needs to be. Adding additional complexities not only makes it intricate past what is required, but may also be a hinderance for future developers working on the same project. In many cases, a good way to secure programs is to ensure that it does what it needs to do and functions exactly how the specifications describe. Additionally, testing for all facets of a project is a good way to ensure security within a project. Identifying what a program should do, should not do, and how it should respond at every prompt is a great methodology for ensuring security and functionality.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by evaluating the specifications that are brought to me, whether vague or intricate, and work  through implementing them sequentially, and through the scope of the person who the program is intended for. This aids me greatly in staying organized and insuring that the end product is exactly what was envisioned or better.


How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software in a forward thinking style of development. I begin by identifying needs and requests, and then create a list of what order I should complete items based on importance and where the occur within the project. Above all else, I am constantly thinking, "if I had to stop programming at any moment, would someone else be able to read, internalize, and pickup from where I left off." To this avail, I try to leave well documented notes within the code as to what everything does. This also aids future developers as it is likely that many people will work on a project in the entirety of it's life cycle. My final thought, which occurs roughly alongside everything else going on, is how am I going to make this secure. I tend to write in a sense that is simple, but leaves little to no space for deviation in response. I find this makes it so that the program is secure in its functions and responds correctly based on what I have written.
